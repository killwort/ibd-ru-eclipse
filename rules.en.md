#### You must have max possible number of towns (depends of your castle lvl), preferably with useful bonuses for guild.
Useful bonuses:

* Daily Task Rewards (max: 400%)

#### You must keep the maximum number of defending troops in all your towns. Use your strongest heroes to form a troop which will be place in towns for defense (or your can use the same troop that you usually use to attack the Guild Boss).

#### If any of your towns was assaulted by other Guild, let us know in the [#battlechat](https://discord.com/channels/713844868165927003/724660107056775180) channel.

#### We have a strong Wall party which may help you to reach 6000-8000 stage (depends on your Core level, Life stone reserves and patience). But while you in the party don't be AFK for days, free slot may be needed for someone else. When you're done farming - quit.
Requests for Wall help shoud go to [#battlechat](https://discord.com/channels/713844868165927003/724660107056775180) channel.
